      *Bib Creator*
This program takes in an input of x .bib files, and produces three .json text files for each with the respective format: IEEE, ACM, NJ.
If any of the fields of the input is empty, it is deemed invalid; thus, its corresponding three output files will be delete.

Specify the path of folder with .bib files and the path of the output files to be stored in at your own liking.
